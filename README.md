# Car_Rental_Project
This was a group project for CPSC-332 at Cal State Fullerton. The website implements CSS, HTML, PHP, and SQL to create a functional website that allows users to signup/login, browse through a selection of cars, and "rent" them if desired.

# Contributors:
Ethan Luu, Jason Tran, and Benjamin Yang

# System Requirements: 
The system shall provide an interface to look through a catalog of available cars to rent. 
The system shall display information about the cars as well as the hourly rates to rent them. 
The system shall allow the user to register their profile on the website by inputting their information and make rentals based on an hourly rate.

# Data Requirements:
Three Entities: User, Car, Transaction
Users must have a unique identification number, name, email, password, username, phone number, time registered, and address
Cars  must have their own unique identification number, make, model, year of that model, color, and price of their hourly rates
Transactions must include both car and user IDs as well as the ID number of that transaction, the time the car was rented and the rate chosen.
